Hello world!,
I am a beginner in programming and I am trying to learn C++.
Write a program that prints "Hello world!" to the console.
I have tried to write the code but I am not sure if it is correct.
Can you help me?
Here is my code:
```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
I am not sure if this is correct. Can you help me?
